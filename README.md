# Breanna Bisnott ECSE3038 Lab 6 Submission

The purpose of this code is for a lab assignment to become more accustomed to the technologies used in consuming APIs using embedded electronics as a web client.

The embedded client is able to make requests to endpoints: `GET /api/light` and `PUT /api/temp`. This will be done by functions `getLight`and `patchTemp`. 

## `getLight`
This function takes the status of the light switch from the website and changes the status of the LED connected to the circuit appropriately.

## `patchTemp`
This function takes the temperature value detected by the temperature sensor and patches the existing temperature, rewriting the value every time.
